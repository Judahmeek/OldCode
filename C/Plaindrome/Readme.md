This is the most technical project that I've worked on so far.

It involves taking an anagram of a palindrome and then calculating the expected number of random swaps to return the given anagram to palindrome form. More information can be found in [the main file.](https://github.com/Judahmeek/OldCode/blob/master/C/Plaindrome/Plaindrome.c)

All code was written and compiled with the Dev-C++ 5.8.3 IDE and TDM-GCC 4.8.1 x64 compiler.
