Traveltrail is an unfinished extracurricular project that I started around sophomore year (2012-2013) because I wanted more experience with software projects that were more complex than the simple assignments we were receiving in class.

It started out as a Oregon trail clone and then pivoted into a framework on which event based text role playing games could be created.
