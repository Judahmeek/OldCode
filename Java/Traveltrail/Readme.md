Traveltrail is an unfinished extracurricular project that I started around sophomore year (2012-2013) because I wanted more experience with software projects that were more complex than the simple assignments we were receiving in class.

It started out as a Oregon Trail clone and then pivoted into a framework for event-driven text-based role playing games.
