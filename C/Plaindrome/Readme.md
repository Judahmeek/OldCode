This is the most technical project that I've worked on so far.

The title of "Plaindrome" is not a misspelling. It's just the most readable anagram of "Palindrome" that came to mind.

This project involves taking a given anagram of a palindrome and then using Markov Chain Analysis to calculate the expected/average number of random swaps to return the given anagram to a palindrome form. More information can be found in [the main file.](https://github.com/Judahmeek/OldCode/blob/master/C/Plaindrome/main.c)

All code was written and compiled with the Dev-C++ 5.8.3 IDE and TDM-GCC 4.8.1 x64.
