#Problem Statement

#Martha is interviewing at Subway. One of the rounds of the interview requires her to cut a bread of size l×b into smaller identical pieces such that each piece is a square having maximum possible side length with no left over piece of bread.

#Input format 
#The first line contains an integer T. T lines follow. Each line contains two space separated integers l and b which denote length and breadth of the bread.

#Output format

#T lines, each containing an integer that denotes the number of squares of maximum size, when the bread is cut as per the given condition.

#Constraints

#1 <= T <= 1000
#1 <= l, b <= 1000

#Sample Input
#2
#2 2
#6 9

#Sample Output
#1
#6

#Explanation
#The 1st testcase has a bread whose original dimensions are 2×2, the bread is uncut and is a square. Hence the answer is 1. 
#The 2nd testcase has a bread of size 6×9. We can cut it into 54 squares of size 1×1, 0 of size 2×2, 6 of size 3×3, 0 of size 4×4, 0 of size 5×5 and 0 of size 6×6. The number of squares of maximum size that can be cut is 6.

cases = int(input())
for o in range(cases):

    while(b!=0):
        r = a % b
        a = b
        b = r
    print(str((dim[0] // a) * (dim[1] // a)))
