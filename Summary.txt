I'm far from an expert in any language. However, I learn fast, enjoy getting my hands dirty, and have attempted to learn the features that are common to most computer languages. When I get stuck, I usually look for guidance through Google with a focus on StackOverflow & official documentation (Reddit has been useful in the past. It also looks like a growing resource, especially for younger languages such as Haskell)
